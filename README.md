# Rust RSA Visualization

The goal of this project is to re-implement the RSA hashing algorithm in Rust, separately from the existing crate. We also plan to implement secure (ish) pseudo-random number generation, for use with the hashing algorithm. If time so permits, we would also like to create some visualization of the steps the algorithm takes when operating on the data being hashed.
